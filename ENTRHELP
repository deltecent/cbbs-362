[Want more detailed help
[Want help on 'A=ABORT' function
The Abort function is used to abort the message entry.  Nothing you have
done is saved.  You will return to the main menu asking which function
you want next.  If you use abort, the system will confirm your intent to
throw your msg away.
][Want help on the 'C=CONTINUE INPUT' function
The CONTINUE INPUT function allows you to continue to input your message
where you left off, unless you have already entered the 20 line maximum.
You will go back into input mode, prompted by the next open line number.
][Want help on 'E=EDIT' function
The EDIT function allows you to edit your message, by doing character
string substitutions within a particular line.  For example, if you have
a line with 'moem' in it, but you wanted it to be 'modem', use the E
command, give the line number, (if not known, find the line number by
using the L command) then when it asks, type: /moem/modem/ 
  The first string will be searched for, and if found, will be replaced
by the second string.  Any printable character may be used instead of
the '/', providing it does not appear in either the old or new string.
For example, to change "11/13/79" to "12/15/79" type: =11/13=12/15= i.e.
use "=" as the delimiter for old and new string.
  E keeps asking for the command, so you can perform multiple changes.
When the line is right, just press return.
  You can "shorthand" the edit command by placing the E command, line
number, old and new, all on one line separated by ";"s.  Thus the above
command becomes: e;3;moem;modem;
 or e;12;11/13/79;12/15/79	(the closing ";" is optional)
  A command of: /// prints the line with no changes.
][Want help on the D and I (line delete and insert) functions
D deletes a line.  You will be asked for the line number.  The following
lines are all moved back 1, so be careful when deleting more than 1
line:  D;1;D;2 would delete lines 1 and 3 because D;1 deleted 1, and
renumbered old lines 2, 3..  into 1, 2...  Therefore to delete the first
2 lines, type: D;1;D;1 (or delete "backwards" - d;2;d;1)

I inserts a line.  You will be asked which line you want the new line
inserted BEFORE, and then will be asked for the new line of data.  
][Want help on the 'G=get msg' function
If you want to get a previous message of yours to make changes to it
instead of keying in a new one use the G command, and when asked, give
the message number to be gotten.  After you get it, you can use all of
the other commands, to modify this message, then save it back with "S".
It will be saved as a new message, the highest one in the system, so be
sure to delete (Kill) the old one you got if that is appropriate.
][Want help on 'L=LIST' function
The List function allows you to list your message, to 'proof read' it,
or to find which line you made a mistake in.  You simply type: L;nn and
the message will be listed starting at line nn.  (or you may type just:
L and will be prompted for the starting line number.)  In CBBS versions
3.0 or later, you may press K or ctl-K to stop the listing.  Control
goes back to the enter subfunctions (not to the main menu, as with
versions of CBBS before 3.0).  ][Want help on 'R=RETYPE' function
The R function allows you to correct mistakes in your message by totally
retyping any line.  The system will ask you for the line number to
change, so be sure you know it in advance.  Use the L (list) command if
you are not sure of the line number.
][Want help on 'S=SAVE' function
You use the Save function when you are satisfied that your message is
correct, and that you want to store it.  CBBS will write the message to
disk, and update the summary file and number of active messages.  When
you want the message erased, you sign on the system and use the (K)ill
function and the password you assigned (if any).
]
]
To get out of message input at any time, just press return twice.  You
will return to the ENTER sub-function menu, and can then use the (A)bort
command to go back to the main menu.
