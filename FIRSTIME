[Want info on using a video terminal with CBBS
When the system is typing, you can use control-S to stop the output to look
at it, then again to continue.  This will allow you to see what is sent
before it scrolls off.

communication within the CP/M User's Group:

][Want a quick summary of what to do your first time
1.  S - Use the S function to retrieve message summaries (or Q for
        quick (subject only) summaries)
    *   When prompted for a starting message number, use -50 to start 50
        back from the highest message on CBBS.
    *   Use control-S to stop/start output.
    *   Write down msg numbers of interest, or..
        Flag the msgs you want to see by pressing F while the NEXT
        summary types (or press return to return to flag a msg you missed).
    *   Use control-K to kill the summary. This automatically starts the
        flagged retrieval.
2.  R - Use R function to retrieve messages of interest.
3.  G - Use the G (Good bye) function when you are done.
        You will be able to leave comments at this time.
