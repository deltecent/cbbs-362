--> To summarize all:
Enter the starting msg #, press return.

--> -nn is also a valid starting number, and means "nn" messages back from the
most recent.

--> To search for a keywords: 
Enter the starting msg #, a comma, then the keyword. Multiple keywords may be
entered, separated by spaces.
Ex: 1,software,sale,club	The commas mean 'or'.

--> To flag a summary for later retrieval:
Press "F" while the N-E-X-T summary is printing. It will acknowledge with
 >F:nnnnn

--> When you have seen enough, press K.  Any flagged messages will then be
retrieved.

[Want more info. on searching
--> A search request looks like:  nn,xxx...
where	"nn" is the starting message number,
	"xxx..." is the search request.

--> Search requests may include "and" and "or".
Use "&" for AND
Use ",", or "|" for OR

-> The most simple search matches any field in the summary, i.e. date, from,
to, subject.
[Want to see some examples
1,bug,fix			all bugs "OR" fixes
1,software&trs			all software "and" trs
1,modem & apple | hayes & apple apple modem info
]
[You can specify which field to search.  Want info

--> Instead of just a keyword, enter:
	x=keyword
where x=
   D  for "date"
   F  for "who from"
   T  for "who to"
   S  for "subject"
Ex:
1,f=ward & s=modem	from ward, subject modem
	This is more specific than
1,ward & modem		which also finds "to ward"

--> You may also use "not equal" instead of "=":
	Either "<>", "!=", or "#" mean "not equal".
Ex:
1,software & <>cp	software, but not cp/m
			anywhere in the msg
1,software & s<>cp	software, and cp/m not
			in the subject
[Want more examples
1,t=all & software & h8	Msgs to all about h8 software
]
]
[Want info on finding "your" messages
The command:
	MINE
will ATTEEMPT to find all messages to you.  It scans for your full name,
or messages to you by first name only.

]
[Want info on auto-retrieve of selected messages
Use the extended Q and S commands: QR and SR, which automatically flag for
retrieval, all selected messages.  You need not explicitly flag them.

If you want to skip one of the auto-retrieved messages, be sure to use C,
and not K, since K will abort completely back to the main menu.
]

Think about your keywords: CP/M would not find  "CPM";
"TRS-80" would not find "TRS80".  Better to use just
"CP" and "TRS".
