[Want description of how to obtain help

CBBS has several kinds of help:

The first is just a short summary of functions.
[Want to know how to get it
Just type a question mark from the main function menu.
]
The second kind of help is based on "keywords" such as "enter", "retrieve",
search", "bye", etc.
[Want to know more about keyword help

Access "Keyword help" from the main function menu (The one that says
"FUNCTION...").

Type the letter "H", then press return.

When asked for a keyword:
    Type a single question mark to see a list of keywords.
or, type the word: keywords
    Type two question marks to see keywords and a brief
explanation of them.
    Should you type a keyword which is not in the file, CBBS will remember
it so we might add it to the file later.
[Want to execute keyword help, now

OK, you can:

  1.  Just be asked for a keyword: H
  2.  List all the keywords:  H then ?
  3.  List all keywords with a 1 line explanation: H then ??

[Want to be asked for a keyword
OK.  You can do this any time from the main menu with the "H" function.

]xh
[Want to list all the keywords
Ok.  Here's the command to list them all. 

]xh;?;;
[Want to see a 1-line explanation of each keyword
]xh;??;;

Now executing "H" (Keyword help command) for you:
]xh
];end of details on keyword help

The third type of help, is self-explanatory:  Some questions include a
phrase such "or type ? for info on searching messages", or some such.  
There is no need to explain these further.

The last kind of help is what you are now doing: simply answering Yes or
No, to some questions.
[Want more details on how it works
Each time we ask you a question, if you answer:
    Y or YES	we will give you some details,
    N or NO	we will skip the details.
    QUIT	You leave help, and go to the main menu.

];end of details on "how it works"
];================================================

Let me try to help you:
[Want to know what kind of info is in CBBS msgs
[Want to know how to look at message summaries
In the main menu, type Q, then when asked for a starting message number,
type 1.  This will list the message numbers and subjects.  You can FLAG a
message for retrieval
[Want to know how
When you see a message of interest, wait until the NEXT message summary is
printing, then press your "F" key.

If you "missed" one you want to go back and flag, press "M" (or your return
key).

]
For more details on the messages, use the S (summary) instead of Q (quick
summary).  It shows the date, who from, and who to, in addition to the
message number and subject which Q prints.

]
Message content overview:

The message numbers below 20 contain information about CBBS, local computer
stores, other dial-in hobbyist systems, etc.

Message numbers from 20-30 give information about local clubs.

The remaining messages are about a variety of computer-hobbyist and ham
related subjects.

[Want to leave CBBS
Use the "G" command (means "good bye") from the main menu. You will be
asked if you want to leave comments. I'll type it for you now:
]xg
[Want to stop your terminal bell from ringing
Use the "P" (Prompt bell) command.  Sorry, but I realize "B" would be
easier to remember, but that was taken for "Bulletin".  I'll execute "P"
command for you now:
]xp
[Want to look over the message summaries on CBBS
Use the "S" (summary) command, or the "Q" (quick summary) command.

It will ask for a starting message number.  To start at the beginning, use
1.  To just review recent messages, use -50, which means to review the most
recent 50 messages.

Returning to main menu...
]q
[Want to see the Welcome again
Just type W in the main menu.  I'll do it for you.
]xw
[Want to see the Bulletins again
Use "B" in the main menu:  I'll do it for you.
]xb
[Want to leave a message
Use the "E" (Enter message) command in the main function menu.  Please
limit the subject matter to Ham/computer/electronic hobby topics, and
personal messages between such people.
[...or did you only want to leave a message for the operators
In that case, the "G" (Good bye) command allows you to leave
comments, which only the operators can see.

Returning to main menu.
]quit
Going into message entry via the "E" command:
]xe
[Is the front part of each line being cut off
	Your terminal needs "nulls" sent to it.  By pressing the "N"
	key while CBBS types, you will get some, 5 more for every time
	you press N.  You can also use the "N" (Nulls) command of the
	main menu, to set EXACTLY how many you need.
	The # of nulls you need is the first # in the next
	line that prints:
123456789	here it is again
123456789
	Here are 8 nulls:  Use "N" to set the exact number needed
]xn;8
[Are characters you type showing up twice
Then your terminal, or modem, is "half duplex" so CBBS has to be, too.  Use
the "D" (Duplex) command to change it. I'll do it for you.  Type D to
change back:

>> Remember, nothing you type will echo.  Type "D" to go back to echoing <<

]xd
[Want to see if you have any messages
Type the command: MINE
It checks for messages to your full name or your first name only.

]xmine
[Want to erase an old message from or to you
You first have to know the message number
[Do you know its message number
Then simply type K in the main menu, and then when asked, give
the message number.  Please be careful not to kill someone
else's message.

Returning to main menu...
]q
OK,  to find the message number, you have to look at the
message summaries.  Do so using the following command:
	MINE
Returning to main menu...
]q

Sorry, but those are the most commonly asked questions.  I have no more in
mind.  I suggest:

    1.	Trying the "H" command, and looking over the keywords, by typing
"?" when asked for a keyword, then type any keyword which might help.

    2.	Leave CBBS by using the "G" (Good bye) command, then when asked if
you want to leave comments, do so, telling us what you needed more help
with.
