Welcome to the 09/24/83 edition of CBBS/NEWS (269 lines)

While it runs, type:

 C  cancel item, go to next
 S  start/stop typing news
 K  kill news; go back to menu

]09/24/83 CHANGES TO MESSAGE EDIT SUBCOMMAND
The (E)dit subcommand of message (E)ntry is more efficient.  Suppose you
had the word "messag" in line 3, and it should be "message".  At best,
you could say "e;3", but then had to wait to be prompted and reply
"/sag/sage/" (the closing "/" is optional).  Now, the "E", line number,
from and to strings may all be stacked with ";"s: e;3;sag;sage; (the
closing ";" is optional).  It will repeat line before and after the
change.

]U COMMAND: RECORD "STATE" OF CBBS.
A new User command: "U", records the state of various commonly changed
CBBS flags, specifically: e(X)pert user mode, (P)rompt bell on/off,
(D)uplex, (C)ase, and SHORT.  

These are Only set by the U command, and allow you to log in the next
time with n;firstname;lastname - and such things as "x;p" will
automatically be set.

]11/14/82 #1 THRU #9 REMEMBERS FLAGGED MSGS
When you flag a message, (flagging with F or M during summary print),
the first 9 msg #'s seen will be remembered in something akin to
"variables" called #1 thru #9.  These numbers may subsequently be used
in K or R commands.

Further, in expert user mode, using the OR, QR, SR commands, or "MINE"
(which executes "OR;1,T=firstname lastname,T=firstname  "), msgs
retrieved will be remembered.  Thus if MINE showed you have 3 msgs, they
may be referred to as #1, #2, and #3.  I hope eventually to add a "reply
#n" command, but its not here yet. This is another attempt to minimize
the need to remember or type actual message numbers.  You could
theoretically now operate CBBS without typing ANY actual msg number.

NOTE: Executing A-N-Y summary command (O, Q, S) forgets the previously
marked msgs, so finish using #n before issuing any other # command.

Also note the "#" command (prints statistics) also now shows you the
marked message numbers.

]USER LOGGING IMPLEMENTED
When you log on, CBBS will place you in a 512-entry USER file.  Each
time you subsequently log on, it will tell you of your last logon and
the high message number at that previous time.

]11/12/82 "*" = PREVIOUS HIGH MESSAGE NUMBER
If you have previously logged on with user logging on CBBS, "*" will
refer to the high number the previous time you called in.  Thus "o;*"
will do a one-line summary of each message entered since your last
logon.

O;*	<== reminder

]11/07/82 "O" command prints one-line summary.
While an occasional line will wrap 80 columns due to length, in general
the (O)ne line summary will allow you to see more at one time on your
screen.

]10/31/82 R;-nn NOW CONSISTENT WITH S;-nn
R;-nn now subtracts "nn" from the next message number the system would
use, and attempts to retrieve that message.  Thus if 1000 were the next
message number, r;-50 would attempt to retrieve 950.  This is now
consistent with S;-nn which would start a summary at 950.

R;- and r;+ (i.e. no numbers) have the same effect as before -
retrieving ten messages sequentially back from (-) or ahead from (+)
which ever message number was most recently referenced.  This allows
"r;-10;+" to retrieve the last 10 msgs, in order.  (you used to have to
do R;- to retrieve them backwards.)

]10/30/82 MODEM COMMANDS IMPROVED: BETTER (D)IR, NEW (H)ELP SUBCOMMAND.
"M" command (D)ir is now more "friendly", showing K instead of extent
and number of sectors.  The total K and number of files is also shown.

The prompt for filename when using (D)ir is now more friendly - telling
you ? and * allowed, or press return for all files.  

A new (M)odem subcommand: (H)elp, gives details on the other modem
commands.

]10/30/82 ^L SHOWS LINE OF "_____"
The "^_" command introduced 10/16 to show you via "fill in the blanks"
how big an input field is, has now been changed to ^L, because of 
terminals that can't generate the ^_.  Most useful in message entry for
determining length of the SUBJ: field.

]10/19/82 MINOR IMPROVEMENTS DOCUMENTED.
When executing the "+" option within message (R)etrieve, CBBS used to
say "No msg xxxxx" for each one not found.  Now it just prints a "- ". 
Thus if you hit a block of no-messages, it types - - - - etc.  Press ^K
to abort. 
In the future, I'll check for the end of the messages, and stop
automatically.

P.S. The + command is a bit faster now - when switching from an even to
an odd msg #, they are in the same message file, so I detect this and
save  re-opening and scanning.  (message 506 and 507 are stored in
"message.x06" - that's how I spread them among 50 msg files).

]10/17/82 TRUNCATE REWRITTEN
You will have many less lines "truncated" now that 80 column input is
supported.  However, I also re-wrote the truncation routine to be more
user friendly.  It backs up one word, then puts you BACK INTO INPUT just
as if you have typed ^R.  You can thus ^U the entire line, or ^W to back
up more words, etc - or just press return to have the line accepted as
is.

]10/16/82 EXPERIMENTAL VERSION IN TESTING.  COMMENTS APPRECIATED.
In response to your comments, and ideas from Randy and Ward, a lot of
new
features were put on today.  Each will have its own news item.

* 80 column output;
* Message continuation;
* Auto-message flagging;
* A "MINE" command finds messages TO you;
* Shortened message numbers in (R)etrieve;
* ESC now supported as ^U (ala IBM PC);
* "Fill in the blanks" via ^L to see how long an input field is;
* File transfer, via pre-arranged password;
* Operator "CHAT" command;

==> Please Report any bugs. 
==> Please report any suggested changes via comments when you (G)o.

]80 COLUMN OUTPUT

Messages are now 20 lines, and 78 columns wide.  Comments are also 78
wide.  Most built-in files (help, etc) are also 80 columns wide. 
Eventually I forsee variable-width output for messages.

]MESSAGE CONTINUATION
If you have something to say that won't fit in 20 lines, finish the
first message, and use the new command:

	CONT

to continue the message.  It auto-enters the E command and all fields,
with a subject of <Cont'd>

]AUTO MESSAGE FLAGGING

Have you ever wanted to flag every message you summarized, such as when
looking for all messages about certain subjects?  Variations of the "Q"
and "S" summary commands are available available to e(X)pert users to
retrieve all selected messages:

	SR;starting msg,search argument
and	
	QR;starting msg,search argument

P-L-E-A-S-E be conservative with them, as it is now very easy to waste a
lot of time on the system retrieving many more messages than you want. 
The more selective you are in your search argument, the better.  Good
examples are: 

	qr;1,1200	find all msgs about 1200 baud modems
	sr;1,f=tom johnson  find msgs from a particular user

]"MINE" COMMAND TO FIND YOUR MESSAGES

"In response to frequent requests", a MINE has been implemented.  It
executes the new auto-summary/retrieve, to find messages to you. 
Specifically, it executes the command:

	"OR;1,T=firstname lastname,T=firstname  "

This will find msgs to you by either your full name, or by your first
name only (for those like WARD, RANDY, who are often called by first
name only).

P-L-E-A-S-E: periodically review messages FROM yourself, to see if they
are obsolete, or if the person you sent it to forgot to kill it after
reading it.  The alternative, having MINE scan for message both TO and
FROM you, is a pain, (it was initially implemented that way, but
changed).

]SHORTER MESSAGE NUMBERS IN (R)ETRIEVE

When you first type R, the message number you enter will be taken
literally.

From then on, the number you enter will be overlaid on the RIGHT of the
previous message number.  Thus:

	r;500;1;2;23;9;00001;2;3

is now shorthand for the former:

	r;500;501;502;523;529;1;2;3

Note that to "UNDO" the leading digits (as in example going back to
message 1), it was necessary to specify the leading 0's.

If you do:

	r;500;2

to retrieve 500 and 502, then get out of retrieve, and come back in
with:

	r;3

you will be getting message 3, not 503.  This was done because new users
might be confused by the shorthand.  Seems the best compromise.

]CONTROL-L TELLS LENGTH OF INPUT FIELD.

Often you want to take advantage of the maximum length of input fields,
particularly when entering a message and specifying "WHO TO" and
"SUBJECT".  Now, typing ^_ will CR/LF, then type a line of _____ letting
you know exactly how long the input field is.  You can type this control
character after partially answering - it will print the "___" line, then
fill it in with what you have typed.  Example:

Subject:?	At this time, you press ^_ and get:
______________________________

CBBS then sends a CR without an LF, for you to key into.

^L acts exactly like ^R, except that it prints the line of "___" first.

]10/16/82 FILE TRANSFER (SOMEWHAT) AVAILABLE

A new command: M is available to support file transfer.  You must have
arranged in advance to know the password.  The disk and user number
accessed is pre-arranged by the operator.  M has a sub-menu supporting
the following commands:

	D	directory of accessible disk
	T	type a file
	R	receive a file from you
	S	Send a file to you
	M	return to main menu.

Any of the main menu functions will also execute from the modem function
menu.  To execute a function which is the same letter in both, you must
explicitly go to the main menu with M first.  For example, to see the
time, but then return to the modem menu, type:

	m;t;m

The first "M" switches to the main menu; the "T" executes the time
function; the second "M" returns to the modem menu.  (You only have to
enter the modem transfer password once - it remains accessible from then
on).

Additionally, a STAT command which shows the space remaining on the
designated disk is available, to know if something you want to send will
fit.

The protocol supported is that of the original MODEM2 program. - i.e. no
CRC.

If you want to abort the transfer, a special test for a total of three
^X characters is made.  Type one about every two seconds until the
transfer aborts.

]NEW COMMAND: CHAT to call the operator.

If you want to ask somthing of the operator, you can see if they are
around by typing the CHAT command.  It rings the terminal bell for a few
seconds, then if the operator didn't show up, returns to the main menu.
