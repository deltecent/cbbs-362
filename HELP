NOTE many of these are synonyms, i.e. multiple keywords which have the
same explanation: (ex: D, DUPLEX, ECHO, DOUBLE, -or- READ, R, RETRIEVE)

][MINE=Info on "MINE" command. The command "mine" attempts to find
message TO you. It executes the following search: (Example using the
name "Ward Christensen")
 "or;1,t=ward chri,t=ward/,t=ward  "
The first searches for your full first name and the first 4 letters of
your last; the second search searches for your first name followed
immediately by a /, as in "WARD/ALL"; the third searches for your first
name only.  The two spaces following the first search ensure it matches
ONLY when the first name is alone at the end of the line.

If you are an expert user, (X command in effect) then the messages will
also be retrieved, and the message numbers, (up to the first 9) will be
stored in "variables" #1 thru #9.  Thus if there were 3 messages found
by "mine", you can go back to re-retrieve the first by "r;#1", the
second by "R;#2", etc.  If you reply to the second, you can kill it via
"k;#2".  Further attempts to R or K #2 will come up "not found".

Although all messages potentially to you will be summarized, only the
ones which arrived since your last call will be retrieved.

Note that "MINE" does not find msgs FROM you.  Do: "s;1,your name" to
find them, since that will match your name in ANY field (from, to, even
subject).  "Policing" for obsolete messages of yours will help the
operator maintain CBBS and is greatly appreciated!
][PARITY=CBBS does not set or test parity.
CBBS sends 8 data bits, i.e. the parity = 0.
][COMMANDS=Help with CBBS commands
[MAIN=
[INFO=
[MENU=CBBS command menus
Typing a question mark when CBBS is asking for a command, will give you
the menu of supported commands.  Use this "H" (keyword help) command for
details about any specific command letter.

When in message entry (E command), a separate menu will be presented.
][MESSAGES=Overview of same
CBBS msgs are 1-20 lines, stored by 5-digit message number.
O command gives one-line summary of them,
S gives older 2-line summary (Takes more time than "O", and only shows
  the message size that O doesn't show).
Q gives quick (subject only) summary.
R retrieves the messages,
E is enter a message.

For additional help, enter any of the above 1-letter commands here, in
(H)elp command.  

==> Be sure to press return to get OUT of (H)elp before trying to
EXECUTE any of these commands. 
][USER=CBBS REMEMBERING ITS USERS
When you sign on, CBBS looks up your name in a table, set up for 512 or
1024 names, depending upon operator option.  It "randomizes" you name to
a particular record, and scans 20 records to see if it finds your name. 
If it doesn't, then it REPLACES the oldest record among those 20.  The
next time you call in, CBBS will have remembered the date, time, and
high message number as of your last call.  See also keyword "*".

Please spell your name correctly and consistently for this to work well!
][*=PREVIOUS HIGH MSG #.
If you have logged into CBBS previously and thus had your user
statistics recorded, CBBS will remember the high message number on your
previous call in a "variable" called "*".  Thus S;* or R;*;+ may be used
to reference the previous high message.  The "#" command also shows the
high message number.  (Technically, * represents the NEXT message to be
entered when you previously signed on).
][U=User command.  The U command records the settings of the following
commands:
  e(X)pert user mode
  (P)rompt bell on/off
  (D)uplex (echo/ho echo)
  (C)ase (upper/lower)
  SHORT (duplicate spaces sent to you or not).
Simply set these as you want, type U, and CBBS will remember them and
restore them the next time you call in, unless you don't call often
enough and a newer caller has overlaid your record. "Often enough" means
roughly once a month, possibly more.  (We HOPE to keep callers records
for 2 months, but circumstances don't always permit that)

U may also allow you to change your password, specifying a new 1-5 char
password.  NOTE: Passwords are not currently enabled.

][NULL=what is a null
A null is a character with a value of 0, sent just to pass time for
terminals that need time after a carriage movement operation.  If you
need them, press control-N while CBBS types to you.  Each ^N will add 5
nulls.  Use the "N" command to set an exact number of them.
][GAMES=Games on CBBS? no.
A very few people, ask CBBS to get games.  Sorry, no.  CBBS is a message
system for sharing creative ideas and best serves that need by remaining
a pure message system. 
][-=use of "-"
r;- retrieves the previous 10 messages.
r;-nn retrieves message "nn" back from the highest.
s;-nn retrieves the summaries "nn" msgs back from the highest.
][LINEFEEDS=CBBS always sends linefeeds
If your terminal or terminal program is double-spacing everything you
see from CBBS, you might have some kind of "auto linefeed" switch set
on.  CBBS uses the standard accepted ASCII character string "CR-LF" at
the end of each line.
][SHORT=Shorten CBBS output by suppressing some characters
[LONG=Un-do what what was done by SHORT command:
[BRIEF=shorten the output CBBS sends you (see also X <expert user>)
The SHORT command causes certain duplicate characters to not be sent. 
The characters are: space, and !"#$%&'()*+,-./ (Ascii 20-2F hex). This
saves time on long distance calls, and generally, makes CBBS usage more
efficient, and only a little bit less readable.

To un-do the SHORT command, type SHORT a second time.
][NEXT=What will the next message number be
[#=What does the # command do
# tells you next caller #, next msg #, and # of active msgs.

If you are in expert mode and have flagged any messages in any of the
summary commands, # will also show the designated message numbers.  See
keyword: MARK.
][MARK=Info on marked msgs
When you flag messages during a summary, or in expert user mode use one
of the auto-retrieve summary scans (QR, OR, SR), the first 9 msgs set
for retrieval will be remembered.  #1 will refer to the first, thru #9
which is the last.  You can then use #5 as the message number in a
retrieve or kill command.

][NEW=How does new user get help (or "what's new"?)
Type HELP from the main menu, rather than just "H".

To find out "what's new" use the "NEWS" command.
][MAIL=Sorry, there are no "mailboxes" on CBBS.
Some people ask if there are, but sorry, not at this time.  To leave
"mail" for someone, just leave them a message with the the "E" command. 
All messages are PUBLIC.  To leave "private mail" for the system
operator, enter comments when you leave via the "Good bye command"
(letter G).
][FUNCTIONS=Misc. details about CBBS functions
R: When you retrieve a msg, you must know its number. Use the (O)ne
line, (Q)uick or (S)ummary command to search message summaries for
keywords.
   The most simple form is: O;1,xxxx   where xxxx is the keyword to
search for.

G: The Good-bye function allows you to leave comments. 

X: toggles you into and back out of expert user mode.  It works at any
time, except in keyword help.  For example, if you are in message entry,
and need more details, type  X   then return.
][HELP="New user" help function
[H=Keyword-oriented help
The "H" command, executed from the main menu, which is what you are
doing right now, is the main way CBBS gives you assistance in its
functions.

Randy suggested, however, that new users don't necessarily "find" the
"H" command, and type "HELP" even though we don't say that is available. 
So, in 7/81, "HELP" was added.  It checks for the more commonly asked
problems on CBBS.

Feel free to try either of them - you can easily abort them.
][CTL CHRS=Help with system control characters.
To correct keying mistakes, you use:

DEL/RUBOUT for character delete on non-video terminals, Control-H (or
backspace) for char delete on a video terminal
Control-R to reshow a corrected line
Control-U to delete a line (ESC works, too, ala IBM PC)
Control-W to video-backspace a word
Control-X to video-backspace a line
Control-L to see how long an input field is

To control CBBS while it types to you, you use:

Ascii, or control characters: C, K, N, and S

C or control-C cancels what is being sent.  Output resumes at the next
information typed, or the next question.  Use it when you know what the
system is going to say/ask, or otherwise don't want to see more of what
is being typed.

K or control-K kills the current function.  It returns you to the
function select menu.  It may be typed alone as the first character on a
line in input mode.  If allowed, it will echo as: ^K  and you must press
return to have it take effect.  If you get a ^K when you don't want it,
cancel it with a control-U.

K or control-K while in message entry returns you to the message entry
menu.  CAUTION:  Older CBBS's returned you to the main menu no matter
where you were.

Each Control-N adds 5 to the number of nulls CBBS sends.

S or control-S suspends output until some other character is typed.  Use
this if you have a video display, and want a see something before it
scrolls off the top of the screen.
][^C=Cancel CBBS output
While CBBS is typing something to you, pressing "C" or Control-C skips
sending to you until the next input, or until the next "piece" of output
(next summary, message, header, etc)
][^E=Send carriage return/Linefeed to your terminal.
Each time you press control-E, CBBS will send a CR-LF to you. It has no
other action to CBBS.
][^H=Backspace to correct typing errors.
Each control-H (or backspace) you send to CBBS deletes another character
from what you had previously typed.  It then echoes a backspace-space-backspace to you, to erase the character. If ^H is not convenient for
you to type, but you want video backspaces, use the "V" command to
assign a new key (such as "\" for your video backspace.
][^K=Kill out of current function.
Pressing "K" or Control-K while CBBS types to you, will usually kill-out
of what you are doing, and go back to the main menu.  Exceptions: In
message entry, ^K returns to the message entry sub-menu; During Q or S
summary, if you have flagged and messages, ^K starts retrieving the
flagged messages;
][^L=Find how long an input field is.
Often you want to take advantage of the maximum length of input fields,
particularly when entering a message and specifying "WHO TO" and
"SUBJECT".  Typing ^L will CR/LF, then type a line of _____ letting you
know exactly how long the input field is.  You can type this control
character after partially answering - it will print the "___" line, then
fill it in with what you have typed.  Example:

Subject:?
 At this time, you type "1200 baud modem for sale", press ^L and get:
1200 baud modem for sale______ 
CBBS then leaves you positioned after the word SALE, showing you have 6
more characters you could have keyed in.

^L acts like ^R, except that it prints the line of "___" first.
][^N=Send 5 more NULLS.
If your terminal or printer needs extra time after CBBS sends each
Linefeed, each control-N you type adds 5 nulls. Use the "N" command to
pick the exact number that works best for you.
][^R=Re-show line.
If you have made changes to a line (by backspacing, or on non-video
terminals, by pressing DEL (or RUBOUT), control-R sends CR/LF then
echoes back the line to you as CBBS sees it.
][^S=Suspend output from CBBS
Pressing S or Control-S, stops CBBS from sending to you. Press another S
to start back up.  Other keys, such as C/R or Q or control-Q will also
work.  Pressing another key which CBBS understands, such as C or K, will
take that key's appropriate action.
][^W=Word backspace.
When keying in, pressing Control-W will cause CBBS to back up over the
last word you keyed in.  For simplicity, words are delimited by either a
space, or a ";".  If it backs up too far, you can press ^C while it is
still backing up, to have it stop backing up.  If you type a line (such
as in a message) that you realize is too long, you can ^W to back up to
make the line short enough to avoid the truncation message CBBS prints.

][^X=Line backspace.
After keying in a line, pressing control-X will cause CBBS to 
backspace-out the line.  While it is backing up, ^C stops it backing up,
and leaves the line containing what you see.
][HEADLINES=
[NEWS=The CBBS NEWS function
NEWS is a simple function of CBBS, intended as an extension of the
bulletin
- to keep the bulletin (relatively) small. NEWS asks if you want
(H)eadlines, or (D)etails.  NEWS will contain the latest changes on CBBS
usage tips, hints, etc. The latest news will always be first.  Typing K
will kill the NEWS function, and return you to the main menu.  The best
way to access news is with the detail option, using C (or ^C) to skip
the details you don't want to see, and K (or ^K) to kill out of it
completely.
][C=Case change command (upper/lower).
[CASE=changing CBBS between Upper-only, and upper-lower case.
The C command changes CBBS between upper-case-only mode, and upper-lower
mode.  CBBS also senses your case when you reply to the "Y/N is this
your first time...".  If you reply with a lower case "y" or "n", CBBS
will flip from the default upper-case-only mode, into lower-upper mode. 
If you enter "Y" or "N", (i.e. upper case) CBBS stays in upper case
mode.  If you (E)nter a message, CBBS will ask if you can handle lower
case (because messages in lower case look nicer). This will only be
asked once.
][ENTER=Help with entering a message into system.
[MESSAGE=How to enter one (see "R" for how to retrieve)
[E=Message entry function
[INPUT=How to input a message to CBBS
The E (Enter) function is used to enter messages into the system.  A
message is any information to be conveyed to 1 or more people.  You may
leave messages for a specific person or group, or "ALL".  It consists of
up to 20 lines, each line up to 78 characters.  You may assign a
password to be able to erase your own messages.  Using the Enter
function, you key in your message just as if you were simply typing it
at a typewriter.  The system will put line numbers at the front of each
line (like a BASIC program).  After the message has been keyed in, you
can edit it, list it, save it, or abort.  See help keyword "ESUB" for
the enter function subcommands.  You can also base your message on a
previous one, getting that msg, and editing it.  See ESUB.
][ESUB=Edit function subcommands.
 Once you have keyed in your message (or part of it) here are the
subcommands of (E)nter you may use:

-(A)bort: discards your message, returns to main function menu.
-(C)ontinue input.  If room, continues inputting at msg end.
-(D)elete a line: You specify the line number.  Following lines are
moved back to fill up the space.
-(E)dit a line: allows a character-string-substitution type edit to be
performed on a particular line. (Example:
/moem/modem/   to correct a misspelled word.
-(G)et previous msg: allows you to fill the edit buffer with the
contents of a previous message, then edit it.  Particularly useful for
updating "for sale" msgs, deleting items sold, changing prices, etc.
-(H)elp types a help file allowing you to get details on any of the
subcommands
-(I)nsert a line: You will be asked for a line number, then to key in a
new line, which will be inserted BEFORE the specified line #.
-(L)ist allows listing from a starting line #.  The entire message from
that line is listed, unless you press K or control-K to skip back to the
Enter subcommand menu.
-(R)etype allows entirely retyping any line, use it when (E)dit would be
too tedious.
-(S)ave saves your message on disk, and returns to the main function
menu.
][UPDATE=Update a message you previously entered.
][EDIT=Editing a message
To edit a message you have already saved, use "E" as though you were
going to enter the message again.  Re-enter who to, subject, etc.  When
prompted "01?" for the first line of text, instead of typing any lines,
press return and in the enter sub-function menu, use "G" to get the
previous message. (You must know its number).  The (H)elp subcommand of
message entry will help you with getting a previous message, and editing
it or what you have just keyed in.
][LEAVE=see "E" to leave a msg, "G" to leave the system
E means to enter a message. G means to say "good bye".
][KILL=
[DELETE=
[ERASE=Help on killing (Erasing) messages. (Use K function)
[K=Kill function

To kill (erase) a message from you to to you, you use the "K" function.
You'll be prompted for the message number.  If the message is found and
is killable, it's summary will be typed for verification that you
entered the correct number.  If it was saved with a password, you'll be
asked for it.
][SUMMARY=Help with system summary function.
[O=One-line Summary command
[S=Summary command
[Q=Quick summary command
[SR=Summary command with auto retrieve
[QR=Quick summary command with auto retrieve
[QUICK=Help with system summary functions.

The (S)ummary function prints 2 lines for each message in the system,
from a given starting message number.  Use ctl-K to abort the summary
listing.  The Summary prints:

 Message number
 # of lines in message
 Date Created
 From
 To
 Subject

The (O)ne line summary squeezes this all on one line, omitting only the
number of lines in the message.

The (Q)uick summary function prints only msg # and subject.

You will be asked for the starting message number, (you need not enter
leading zeros).   Alternatively, you may enter a number of the form -n,
where n is number representing 'n back from current high'. For example
q;-15 would start the scan from the 15th most recent message.  (or, you
could type Q, then press return, and when asked for the starting message
#, reply with -15).  ";" is used to separate "anticipated" answers.

See help keyword "SEARCH" for info on searching messages. See help
keyword "FLAG" for flagging msgs for retrieval while the Q or S summary
is running.

Use OR, QR or SR to summarize AND retrieve the messages.  Example:
or;1,modem  will retrieve all messages with "MODEM" anywhere in the
subject, who from, or to.

][SEARCH=Help with searching summaries for content.
[FIND=Find message with certain contents or from or to.
[SCAN=Scan messages for content

The (O)ne line summary, (S)ummary and (Q)uick summary commands allow you
to search the summary for specific keywords.

When asked for the starting message number, type ? to get help on how to
search.

Most simply, to search, enter the starting message number (usually 1), a
comma, then a keyword to search for.

Use as short a keyword as possible which will still be unique.  Being
too specific might miss some messages.

Use help keyword "BOOLEAN" for info on using "and", "or", and "not" as
well as field specifications, while searching.
][BOOLEAN=Doing "and", "or" and "not" while searching.
[AND=using "and" to search messages
[OR=using "or" to search messages
(( IF you were looking for "OR" as "One line summary with Retrieve, use
   keyword "SR" ))

The S and Q commands allow a search string, after you type the starting
message number (then a comma).  Example:

 s;1,cp/m

You can specify fields, such as "F=WARD" which means "From Ward", etc.

For full details, use the S command, but when asked for a starting
message
number, type a question mark:  ?
][RETRIEVE=Help with retrieving messages.
[RETREIVE=Mis-spelling of "RETRIEVE"
[READ=read a message
[R=The retrieve function.

The retrieve ("R") function is used to retrieve a message from the
system.  You must know the message number, which you can find using the
S (summary) or Q (quick summary) function.  You will stay in "retrieve
mode" until you press return to go back to the function menu.

NOTE:  When asked for a message number:
 + means the "next 10" messages
 - means the "last 10".
Using "-" before you do any other message summary or retrieve, will
cause CBBS to start retrieving backwards from the latest message.  There
is no backwards-summary capability.

Once you are "IN" the retrieve function, CBBS will continue to ask you
for message numbers.  You can "shorthand" them by specifying only the
low-order digits that have changed from the previous number you entered. 
Thus,

 r;500;3

will retrieve 500 and 503.  To then retrieve message 1, you'd have to
specify 00001, because just 1 would be taken to mean 501.

See keyword "FLAG" for info on flagging summaries for later retrieval.
][FLAG=Flag msgs for retrieval while summary types
[F=Press "F" during summary to flag for retrieval
[M=Press "M" during Q/S summary to flag ones you missed

While the "Q" (quick) or "S" (Summary) is typing, you can ask that a
message be flagged for automatic retrieval. Just press your "F" key,
during the N-E-X-T summary. (That gives you time enough to see the
complete summary of the message you might want to flag).

To flag the last summary, press F while CBBS types the line 
"------END OF SUMMARY------"

NOTE: At baud rates greater than 300, or with the "Q"uick summary, you
might not have enough time to decide to flag a msg.  In that case,
pressing "M" (or Return, which is actually control-M), will have CBBS
ask for the msg #.  You may type a single number, or multiple numbers,
separated by ";".  The first number will be taken literally.  Subsequent
numbers on the same line separated by ";" will overlay the RIGHT part of
the first number.  Thus if CBBS prompts "Msg #'s: to retrieve" and you
reply 12345;6;7;78, it will stack requests to retrieve 12345, 12346,
12347, and 12378.

The QR, OR, and SR commands automatically flag ALL selected messages for
retrieval.
][STOP=Stop CBBS
To leave CBBS, use the G command (Means <G>ood bye). To stop output from
CBBS, press C to stop some, K to <K>ill back to the main menu, (or the
message entry menu if you are in <E>nter.)

There may also be a STOP command, which sets the # of stop bits on the
modem to 1 or 2.
][END=
[EXIT=
[OFF=
[LOGOFF=
[QUIT=Want to "quit" out of CBBS?
[GOODBYE=How to sign-off the system.
[G=The GOODBYE function.
[BYE=Leaving CBBS.
[COMMENTS=Leaving comments about CBBS without entering a msg.

Typing G when asked for the function, will get you off the system.  You
will give you a chance to leave comments about the system, just by
keying lines in. (no editing, etc).
][NULLS=Help with system sending nulls.
[N=The Nulls function.

Certain terminals require nulls to be sent to them following a carriage
return/line feed, for instance the T.I. Silent 700 series.  The 'N'
function is used to set the number of nulls, to any value from 0 to 255.

However, if you need nulls, you would want to get them from the
beginning.  While the system is typing, pressing control-N will cause
the system to send 5 nulls after each linefeed.  Each time CBBS sees you
type an ^N, it adds 5 to the number of nulls being sent.  Use the "N"
COMMAND to set exactly how many you need (experiment with it).
][PHONE=
[BULLETIN=Help with retrieving Bulletin and Welcome messages.
[B=Bulletin reprint function.
[WELCOME=Help with retrieving Bulletin and Welcome messages.
[W=Welcome reprint function.

When you first got onto the system, the system typed a "Welcome"
message.  It included some useful information such as a brief summary of
the control characters accepted by this system.  Then, if there were any
bulletins, they printed.

If you missed either (used "C" or control-C) or just want to see them
again, function 'W' will retype the welcome message, and function 'B'
will retype the bulletin.

If the operators voice phone numbers are available, they are in the
bulletin.
][DUPLEX=Help with system character echoing features.
[D=The Duplex (Echo) function.
[ECHO=Help with system character echoing features.
[DOUBLE=Is your terminal typing every character twice?

The D (for Duplex) function switches the system between Full Duplex
(which echoes what you type) and Half Duplex (which doesn't echo what
you type) mode.  Some teletypes and other devices print immediately when
you press a key, so you don't want the system to echo characters back to
you.  Use the D function to switch to or from this mode.

Note the "U" command will remember the setting of "D" for your next
call.

Also note, that if CHAT is available, you cannot CHAT in half-duplex,
because the operator can't see what you're typing.
][BELL=Help with system Prompt (bell on/off) function.
[PROMPT=Help with system Prompt (bell on/off) function.
[P=The prompt (bell) function

Every time the system wants you to type something, it sends you a
question mark, then a bell character.  The P function may be used to
toggle the sending of the bell prompt.  Using P flip/flops this function
(bell on, bell off, etc). The bell ALWAYS rings in column 75 to warn you
of the 78 char line length limit for message input.

Note the "U" command will remember the "P" setting for your next call.
][EXPERT=Help with eXpert users mode.
[X=The expert mode function

The X function puts you into expert user mode.  It shortens all prompts,
and deletes some lines such as the headers in the summary print.  Use it
to save time after you have become familiar with the system.

As of CBBS 3.5, "X" works at any time - if a prompt is too "cryptic"
because of being in expert mode, just type X then press return.  The
longer prompt will then be given.  NOTE THAT it DOESN'T work in HELP
(where you are now) because "X" means a request for the help on the X
command.

Experts will also want to take advantage of the ";" character to
separate multiple answers.  For example, a typical logon would be:
  n;firstname;lastname

Note the "U" command will remember the "X" setting for your next call.
][USE=Help with using system efficiently.

1) Minimize connect time: only 1 phone into system.
2) Press "C" to cancel typing if you know what is being typed or don't
want to see more.
3) Use message summary retrieval to see what messages you want to see. 
For example, use o;-50 to see the one-line summaries of the last 50
msgs.
4) If you plan on leaving a message, have it well thought out to
minimize the 'compose' time while you are on the system.
5) Once you learn the questions being asked, answer multiple questions
in advance by separating your answers with a semicolon (for example: s;1 
or r;23;24;25).
][VIDEO=Help with video backspace function.
[BACKSPACE=Help with video backspace function.
[V=Video backspace mode function.
If you are on a video terminal which can backspace, use your backspace
key to correct a character.  (Backspace is ctl-H)

(If you want video backspaces echoed to you, but you want to press a key
other than ^H, use the "V" command to select an additional backspace
character, such as "\" or DEL/Rubout.)

If you are on a non-backspacing terminal, use DEL (sometimes labeled
RUBOUT) to delete a character.

On video terminals, you can also use ^W for word delete, and ^X for line
delete.  You can even ^C out of them (!!) (i.e. as it is backing up, ^C
to stop it), if you realize you have gone too far.  (a nit, but neat!)
][TAB=Use of control-I (TAB) characters.

When entering messages, you may now utilize the control-I or tab key. 
This will allow you to format your messages without adding too much
space to our files. The tab key spaces over to the next tab field which
is 8 characters wide.
][FILES=Some information about CBBS file usage

 >> This item has 80+ lines.  Press K to kill typing <<

CBBS is a 20-some K 8080 machine language program running under CP/M. 
It is entirely self-contained.
  CBBS uses many files on disk.  They are:

 CBBS.COM
The CP/M command file: the machine language CBBS program. 

 NEXT
Contains the next caller #, msg #, and # of active messages. If there is
a ">> FLASH <<" it also comes from this file.

 USERS
This file contains up to 512 (optionally, 1024 or 2048) most recent
caller entries.  Each entry looks like:
    486, ,JOSEPH JENSEN        ,OEIAD,11/20/82,08:04,00731,016 G
These fields are: caller number, special user flag, name, encrypted
password, date, time, and high msg # of last call, and position number
in user file.  The "G" is an encoded byte containing the e(X)pert,
(P)rompt, (D)uplex, SHORT, and (C)ase flag settings (set by U command).

When you call in, your name is hashed to a slot in the file.  A search
is made forward for up to 20 names to find you.  If you are not found,
the oldest caller in that 20 is overlaid with your call.  Thus
misspelled or one-time callers are eventually deleted without explicit
maintenance.

 SUMMARY
This is a file with the 2-line summary for each message. The format of
the file is:
^Gnnnnn,ll,mm/dd/yy,who from,who to, subject,password
  where nnnnn is the message #, ll the # of lines.
The password is the one the user asked for when entering the message.  A
special password is used to completely disallow certain messages from
being erased.

 MESSAGE.Xnn
There are from 1 to 50 message files.  Small CBBS systems might have as
few as 1 (or more practically, say, 10). A "full blown" CBBS has 50
message files.   NOTE:  Typically, CBBS.COM, NEXT, SUMMARY, and all
MESSAGES are on one disk.  The following files are typically on another
disk:

 BULLETIN
Contains exactly what you see when you log on, or use "B"

 ENTINTRO
The file typed when you go into "E" message entry, and want some help

 ENTRHELP
The help file which is interpreted when you use the "H" sub-command of
message entry.

 FIRSTIME
When you say "Y" to "Y/N is this your first time..." this is the help
file which is interpreted

 FUNCTION
Contains a list of supported functions.

 HELP
Contains a list of keywords, and their explanations. The "H" or "HELP"
command accesses it.

 NEWS
A file of most-recent-at-the-top news items.  Each has a 1-line
headline.  The NEWS command accesses it.

 SCANHELP
When you use "S" or "Q", and ask for help on searching messages, this is
the help file which is used.

 WELCOME
Contains the welcome message typed when you log on, or ask for the "W"
command.

 LOG
Contains a log of the date, time, caller number, baud rate, name, and
elapsed time, for each call.  Also contains notes about attempts to kill
protected messages, and comments (entered at the "G" command).

 KILLED
Contains the entirety of every message killed.  Allows us to review
messages which were entered, seen, and killed without our having seen
it.  Also allows the "RESTORE" command to easily restore any erroneously
killed message.

 SYNONYM
Contains "translations" from "english" (or other systems) to CBBS
commands.  This allows a neophyte to type BYE, or READ, etc. 
Experienced users should be able to remember the main 1-letter commands
and not need this.

 ----
NOTE: HELP files such as ENTRHELP or SCANHELP have a special format:  A
line starting with a special character is interpreted as a question.  It
is typed.  If the answer is "Y", then the information in the following
lines up to the next special character, are typed.  If "N" is answered,
the lines up to the next special character are skipped.  The HELP file
is similar, except that the special character lines have the format
(special char)KEYWORD=description, and there may be synonyms for each,
such as:
 >SUMMARY=Help with system summary function.
 >S=Summary command
 >QUICK=Help with system summary functions.
 >Q=Quick summary command
blah blah this is the details about Q and S blah blah

Hope you found this interesting and informative.
][SOFTWARE=What software drives CBBS. (more info, msgs 9-11)
CBBS is a 20-some K 8080 machine language program written by Ward
Christensen, and running under the popular 8080/Z-80 CP/M operating
system.  In source form, CBBS is a 12000+ line 8080 assembler program.

Information on CBBS (ordering, pre-reqs, etc) are in msgs 9-11

The ideas for CBBS came from Ward, Randy, and Y-O-U, through your
comments.
 ----
CBBS is a trademark of Randy Suess and Ward Christensen. Z-80 is a
trademark of Zilog, Inc. CP/M is a trademark of Digital Research.
][FLIP=CBBS does not support flipping to answer mode on our modem.
Occasionally some modems work better when the sending end (CBBS in this
case) is in originate, rather than answer mode on the modem.  CBBS
doesn't support that at this time.  Leave a comment if you feel it is
really necessary.
]################################################################
 Following unique to particular systems, change as needed:

][SIGNON=Info about signing on to CBBS
CBBS has specific requirements for signing on.  Some people learn of the
CBBS phone number, but only "stumble" into this information:

CBBS accepts 110, 300, 600 or 1200 baud at sign-on.  Several carriage
returns must be pressed for CBBS to detect the baud rate.  Once a C/R is
seen at a particular speed, a second C/R's must be seen to validate the
speed.  Thus terminals that send auto-linefeeds won't be able to log on.

CBBS sends 8 bits with no parity and does not test nor set parity.
][STAT=Determines disk storage
Particularly used when using the M command to receive a file, and you
want to be sure there is room for it.  If you have not executed the M
command and entered the password, STAT shows the room left on the CBBS
disk, which may or may not be the same as the modemming disk.
][OTHER=info on other dial-in systems: see msgs 12-15
][CPM=
[DOWNLOAD=No file xfers here.
[CP/M=CBBS doesn't allow access to CP/M
This is only a message system.  We handle > 50 callers per day, and to
handle upload/download would prevent us from being able to handle this
much message traffic.  See message 15 for info on Chicago area remote
CP/M systems, i.e. systems from which you CAN upload/download CP/M
programs.
][HARDWARE=What hardware makes up the system.
CBBS/Chicago is running in a 64K N* mainframe, with 4Mhz Z-80 CPU, UDS
modem, local terminal, hard disk, Scitronics clock board, etc.
][CHAT=operator chat facility on CBBS.
Typing CHAT will ring the CBBS terminal bell, and call for the operator. 
If there is no answer, control returns to the main menu.  Leave a
comment instead, using the (G)ood bye command.
][SALE=
[SELL=How to sell something via CBBS; Do we sell CBBS?
We welcome "for sale" messages on CBBS, for items related to computer
hobbying, ham radio, and electronic experimenting.
-- Simply use "E" to enter the message
-- Put "for sale" as well as W-H-A-T you are selling, IN the subject, so
that the "Q" and "S" summary commands show WHAT is for sale, ex: "apple
modem for sale" or "2716's for sale".  Fewer people will likely look at
your message if you just say "for sale" and don't say what.
--- 
To search for items for sale, type: o;1,sale
---
CBBS software is for sale.  See messages 9, 10, and 11.
][CLUB=Club news on CBBS
[CLUBS=
Local computer club news is on CBBS, starting at message 20.
It is not necessarily frequently updated - depends upon who gives us
information.
][CBBS=What is CBBS
[OVERVIEW=Overview of CBBS
Keywords "CBBS", "OVERVIEW":
CBBS, the Computerized Bulletin Board System, was conceived in January,
1978, by Ward Christensen and Randy Suess, for communicating messages
between computer hobbyists (HAMS, electronics experimenters, etc).

][PASSWORD=Help with protecting messages with password.
When you enter your message, you will be asked for a password.  If you
just press return, no password is assigned, and anyone can kill it,
although presumably the person you sent it to will.  To protect the
message, choose any 4-characters as the password.  Then only you, or
someone knowing your password, or the system operators, can kill it.
][MODEM=CBBS uses a UDS modem, doesn't allow MODEM file transfers.
][NEWBAUD=
[ALTER=
[BAUD=
[1200 BAUD=Now available
[SPEED=Help with altering system baud rate.
[A=The Alter baud rate function.
(Revised 07/26/83) CBBS recognizes 110, 300, 600, and 1200 baud at
initial sign on. The (A)lter baud rate command is temporarily
unavailable, and thus the 450, 525, and other "PMMI" baud rates are not
available.

If you came in at 300 baud and want to switch to 1200, you'll have to
hang up and call back in with a 1200 baud modem.

For neophytes: 110 to 600 baud use what is called the "Bell 103" type of
modem, and 1200 baud uses the "Bell 212".  The means of modulating and
demodulating the signal is different for each, and requires the
appropriate modem on your terminal or computer.
][TIME=Description of system Time function.
[T=The Time function.

Typing 'T' will return the current date, time and total elapsed time
that you have been on the system.  This information is also written to
the system Log file when you use the G command.  Please don't just hang
up - we like to be able to do little "statistical studies" on logon
time, etc.
][OPERATOR=
[OPERATORS=Who runs this CBBS.
Ward Christensen and Randy Suess jointly designed and maintain CBBS.
][WHY=Why does CBBS exist.
CBBS exists because we thought it would be an interesting way to share
ideas with other hobbyists.  We paid for and maintain it ourselves. 
Thanks to Lloyd Smith for a memory board donation, and making things
available at a low cost, and to Les Freed for a good buy on our drives.
